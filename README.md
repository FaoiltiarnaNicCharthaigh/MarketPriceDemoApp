A demo application to read data from a csv file, display the data in a graph, and save the data to an SQL database


## Requirements

Design an application to read data from the sample file provided, store to a database, and display
the data in a graph format.
- The solution can be a webapp or winforms and can be a framework or newer Core application, it is to
demonstrate the use of the Microsoft stack (C#, .net)

technology)
Either on the graph or in separate components display the following from the data:
minimum and maximum
average of the series
Most expensive hour window (i.e. two consecutive half hourly values) for the data
